Jacob: issue #7617 - set_ylabel() doesn't work with AxesZeroSubplots. The problem was that AxesZeroSubplot() sets both axis to be instances of Xaxis. Thus, when the axes were being drawn it wouldn't look to the Yaxis to find the label. THe problem was in AxesZeroSubplot() not set_ylabel().
Nishant: issue #7194 - Bug in AxesStack.add
Steven: Issue #8089 - Using Minute Locator to set x-axis ticks exceeds Locator.MAXTICKS
