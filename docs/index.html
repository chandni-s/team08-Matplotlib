												<h4>Steven Diao</h4>
												<p>I am a computer science student currently in my last year of studies; I've always had a passion for computer science ever since high and have dabbled into multiple side projects. Throughout all my experiences I've had the pleasure of being about to come across a wide array of different languages such as Java, python and C# which helped the diversity of all my projects. A lot of the side projects I've worked on revolve around the game engine unity; I go to game jams (hackathons for game development) every year and work on new and creative projects each year with other game developers. Last year I was also able to do a PEY term which lasted a year, in my job placement I was able to work with a wide variety of technologies and experience what it is like to work in a large agile team with daily scrum meetings.</p>

												<h4>Nishant Desai</h4>
												<p>As a recovering coffee addict, I am currently pursuing a bachelors in computer science in the comprehensive stream at University of Toronto. My favourite courses at the University of Toronto have been Computer and Network Security and Algorithms. As if that were not enough, I have had two successful (but long) work terms as part of the Co-op program at University of Toronto. The first work term consisted of quality assurance work, specifically writing unit tests as well as front end user testing which lasted for eight months. The next work term was a hefty sixteen months long for which I developed many types of Microsoft applications within a core ERP software package.  The quality assurance and development experience provides me with the skills and knowledge I need in order to become an effective team member. I plan to apply my skills that I have developed in these two years in order to build a great project.</p>

												<h4>Henry Liu</h4>
												<p>I am currently completing my 4th year of my Bachelor's Degree as a Specialist in the Computer Science Software Engineering Stream at the University of Toronto. I enjoy solving problems and find motivation in helping others. I am also a part of the Coop program and have experience in IT, QA, and Software Development positions. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have worked with programming languages such as Java, C, Python, and SQL. Through my work terms, my interest in development have led to work with other languages such as VBA, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am familiar with software development tools such as Eclipse, GitHub, and SVN, as well as project management tools such as Trello. I can work well in both an independent and a team environment. I believe I can be great contributor in any project and I am confident in my logical thinking, creativity, communication, and organization skills. Away from the desk, I enjoy building relationships through physical activities including basketball, snowboarding, mixed martial arts, and volleyball.</p>

												<h4>Chandni Sehgal</h4>
												<p>I am a computer science specialist currently in my fourth year, aiming to graduate in spring 2017. I was initially exposed to programming in high school during grade 11. I realized my passion for technology when I explored other courses and programs for a year, and did not find anything else as interesting and compelling as computer science. I took an opportunity of having a prolonged internship experience for sixteen months at IBM, where I was able to learn many new programming languages such as ReactJs, NodeJs, C++ and Perl as well as optimized my skills in Java and Python. Furthermore, I had an opportunity to explore my enthusiasm for teaching by becoming a TA for a database course in the fall term. I am continuing with my passion in current semester by TA’ing the same subject at downtown. Through this course, I aim to utilize my teamwork and technical skills to contribute to an open source project and hope to have a good learning experience overall.</p>

										<p>Team work is a great opportunity one could have however, if not managed properly it can become a disastrous experience. In Forkestra, all the team members have tremendous group work experiences both in the industry and in school. Through these experiences, we all agree on the fact that the key for success in a team environment project is communication.</p>

										<p>In order to keep the team focused on our project and have a successful term overall, we have agreed to use various modern development and project management tools. This includes: GitHub to manage our project code, a Slack channel for project related communication, a Facebook group chat for emergency issues and Trello which would act as our scrum board to keep up with the progress of our work. Considering the fact that the team members are taking other courses as well, we have agreed to have two mandatory meetings each week; one on Thursdays where each team member will decide what they will work on over the weekend. We agree to have another team meeting on Mondays after meeting with TA where we will examine the feedback given by our TA and go over the work done over the weekend. The frequency of these meetings will escalate as we approach closer to a deliverable due date for the project. </p>
