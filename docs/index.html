                                <p>I am a computer science student currently in my last
                                    year of studies; I've always had a passion for
                                    computer science ever since high and have dabbled
                                    into multiple side projects. Throughout all my
                                    experiences I've had the pleasure of being about
                                    to come across a wide array of different languages
                                    such as Java, python and C# which helped the
                                    diversity of all my projects. A lot of the side
                                    projects I've worked on revolve around the game
                                    engine unity; I go to game jams (hackathons for
                                    game development) every year and work on new
                                    and creative projects each year with other game
                                    developers. Last year I was also able to do a
                                    PEY term which lasted a year, in my job placement
                                    I was able to work with a wide variety of technologies
                                    and experience what it is like to work in a large
                                    agile team with daily scrum meetings.</p>

                                <p>As a recovering coffee addict, I am currently pursuing
                                    a bachelors in computer science in the comprehensive
                                    stream at University of Toronto. My favourite
                                    courses at the University of Toronto have been
                                    Computer and Network Security and Algorithms.
                                    As if that were not enough, I have had two successful
                                    (but long) work terms as part of the Co-op program
                                    at University of Toronto. The first work term
                                    consisted of quality assurance work, specifically
                                    writing unit tests as well as front end user
                                    testing which lasted for eight months. The next
                                    work term was a hefty sixteen months long for
                                    which I developed many types of Microsoft applications
                                    within a core ERP software package. The quality
                                    assurance and development experience provides
                                    me with the skills and knowledge I need in order
                                    to become an effective team member. I plan to
                                    apply my skills that I have developed in these
                                    two years in order to build a great project.</p>

                                <p>I am currently completing my 4th year of my Bachelor's
                                    Degree as a Specialist in the Computer Science
                                    Software Engineering Stream at the University
                                    of Toronto. I enjoy solving problems and find
                                    motivation in helping others. I am also a part
                                    of the Coop program and have experience in IT,
                                    QA, and Software Development positions. Throughout
                                    my undergraduate studies, I have worked with
                                    programming languages such as Java, C, Python,
                                    and SQL. Through my work terms, my interest in
                                    development have led to work with other languages
                                    such as VBA, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am familiar
                                    with software development tools such as Eclipse,
                                    GitHub, and SVN, as well as project management
                                    tools such as Trello. I can work well in both
                                    an independent and a team environment. I believe
                                    I can be great contributor in any project and
                                    I am confident in my logical thinking, creativity,
                                    communication, and organization skills. Away
                                    from the desk, I enjoy building relationships
                                    through physical activities including basketball,
                                    snowboarding, mixed martial arts, and volleyball.</p>

                                <p>I am a computer science specialist currently in my
                                    fourth year, aiming to graduate in spring 2017.
                                    I was initially exposed to programming in high
                                    school during grade 11. I realized my passion
                                    for technology when I explored other courses
                                    and programs for a year, and did not find anything
                                    else as interesting and compelling as computer
                                    science. I took an opportunity of having a prolonged
                                    internship experience for sixteen months at IBM,
                                    where I was able to learn many new programming
                                    languages such as ReactJs, NodeJs, C++ and Perl
                                    as well as optimized my skills in Java and Python.
                                    Furthermore, I had an opportunity to explore
                                    my enthusiasm for teaching by becoming a TA for
                                    a database course in the fall term. I am continuing
                                    with my passion in current semester by TA’ing
                                    the same subject at downtown. Through this course,
                                    I aim to utilize my teamwork and technical skills
                                    to contribute to an open source project and hope
                                    to have a good learning experience overall.</p>

                            is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal.
                            That is, it is a run chart of outstanding work. It is
                            useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.
                            Since this delieverable was only bug fixes we did not
                            add story points to our trello cards. Thus, we can not

										<p>Team work is a great opportunity one could have however, if not managed properly it can become a disastrous experience. In Forkestra, all the team members have tremendous group work experiences both in the industry and in school. Through these experiences, we all agree on the fact that the key for success in a team environment project is communication.</p>

										<p>In order to keep the team focused on our project and have a successful term overall, we have agreed to use various modern development and project management tools. This includes: GitHub to manage our project code, a Slack channel for project related communication, a Facebook group chat for emergency issues and Trello which would act as our scrum board to keep up with the progress of our work. Considering the fact that the team members are taking other courses as well, we have agreed to have two mandatory meetings each week; one on Thursdays where each team member will decide what they will work on over the weekend. We agree to have another team meeting on Mondays after meeting with TA where we will examine the feedback given by our TA and go over the work done over the weekend. The frequency of these meetings will escalate as we approach closer to a deliverable due date for the project. </p>

                    <h3>Matplotlib</h3>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="display:inline-block">
                        <p>Matplotlib is a program created by John D Hunter to plot
                            graphs and other functions similar to MATLAB. The program
                            is an open source on github and has been going strong
                            among developers and users, despite John dying in 2012. </p>

                            <p>Matplotlib is broken up
                            into three main layers which builds on top of each other.
                            These layers are, from top to bottom respectively: the
                            Scripting Layer, the Artist Layer, and the Backend Layer.
                            Each one of these layers is abstracted from each other
                            and does not rely on the any of the layers above it.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>The scripting layer</b>: is the interface between the
                            user and the matplotlib library, mainly using the pyplot
                            module. Pyplot provides interaction with the classes
                            in the layers below it. This allows the user to easily
                            generate and manipulate graphs through simple method
                            calls, such as plotting a graph like below: </br><pre>import matplotlib, pyplot as plt
                            </br>plt.plot();</pre></p>

                            <p>PyPlot is an implementation
                            of a stateful program which helps with its memory usage.
                            It does so by using different states to keep track of
                            things like current figure, canvas area and current axes.</p>

                            <p><b>Transition Scripting Layer -> Artist Layer</b>:
                            PyPlot imports all classes of the artist layer
                            such as Axes, subplots, Lines, Artist, Figure and others
                            which it uses in its functions to tell the machine what
                            to draw. It does so through appropriate sequences of
                            method calls to the respective classes. This translate
                            to a high degree of coupling from the Scripting
                            Layer to the Artist Layer.</p>

                            <p><b>The Artist Layer</b>:
                            The main goal of the artist layer is to draw the
                            graph based on parameters passed in the scripting layer.
                            It consists of 2 different types of artists, primitives
                            and containers. Primitive objects represents the basic
                            images needed to make graphs such as Line 2D, Rectangle,
                            Text and other images. Container objects represents where
                            you draw the primitives on, such as Axis, Axes, and Figure.</p>

                            <p>In the Artist layer, the Figure class is the base class
                            needed to instantiate everything else; it is the window
                            on which Axes and subplots are drawn. The Axes class
                            contains most of the elements such as Text, Line, Axis
                            and Ticks (These aggregate dependencies are left out of the UML diagram below for neatness sake)
                            . Each Axes object has a subplot object assigned
                            to it, which is used to manipulate properties of these
                            elements. The subplot class is what actually controls
                            the graph on the screen and as people change parameters
                            and elements of a graph, they call functions within subplot
                            and Axes class.<p>
                            <p><b>Transition Artist Layer -> Backend Layer</b>:
                            When the artist wants to render the graph
                            on the screen, it calls on the RendererBase class
                            which is the gateway to the backends package that renders
                            the pictures. This structure provides a low coupling between the two layers.</p>

                            <p><b>The Backend layer</b>: is the
                            layer which handles rendering the actual graph on screen.
                            The backend package handles displaying all the physical
                            properties of lines, such as colors and plots to show
                            up on the screen. The classes FigureCanvasBase,
                            RendererBase and GraphicsContextBase
                            implement the backend layer to handle creating the canvas,
                            rendering the images, and rendering the colors respectively.</p>

                     <p ><b>Potential Improvements</b> </p>
                            <p>1) We've noticed that there were numerous imports from the Scripting Layer (pyplot) to the Artist Layer (Axes, Labels, etc). This could cause problems if any of the classes depended on gets deprecated or refactored. Also, if there was a desire to implement a new interface in place of pyplot, it could be an ordeal to ensure every needed dependencies are imported. An interface in the Artist Layer could reduce the level of coupling between it and the Scripting Layer.</p>
                            <p>2) In the factory design pattern involving _Subplots.py to generate AxesSubplots objects, Subplot_class_factory generates different types depending on input; however, the generated classes is always inherting from SubplotBase. If new parent objects were introduced, the current design would require additional condition statements, which does not follow the Open/closed principle of Object-Oriented methodology.</p>

                            <p style="padding-right:15px">When it comes time to draw the the actual figure a Decorator
                                pattern is used. The Decorator is important to allow
                                customization to your chart. With a Decorator you
                                can have a chart with any permutation of lines, images,
                                text, legends, etc. Each part of the figure has access
                                to the Artist class located <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/artist.py">here</a>                                (lines were only drawn connecting figure becasue
                                when creating a new window the Artist begins with
                                the Figure class, but all the classes on the right
                                extend Artist, when it needs to be drawn it hands
                                its draw() method to Artist which in turn gives it
                                to the renderer to actually draw. Think of the Renderer
                                as the paintbrush and the Artist as the one who knows
                                how to paint. This Decorator spans two layers: the
                                Artist and the Backend. The order that objects are
                                drawn is determined by a value in each of the classes
                                called zorder, and the actual drawing takes place
                                in a function call allow_rasterization located in
                                artist.py. </p>

                            <p>There is actually a lot of setup that must go into the
                                backend before the actual drawing can occur. To help
                                your understanding you can look at the sequence diagram
                                (the second diagram) to the right that shows and

                            <p>This Factory is used when adding subplots to a figure.
                                A figure can contain multiple Axes which contain
                                subplot information defined in the subplotBase class.
                                When the user adds a new subplot, the current figure's
                                <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/figure.py">add_subplot</a>                                method will run which in turn asks for a new instance
                                of a subplot. The SubplotBase class is meant to be
                                used as an interface. We don't want the current Figure's
                                Axes to contain an instance of SubplotBase. So instead matplotlib
                                dynamically creates an instance of the class AxesSubplot
                                which will have all the methods of SubplotBase. Both
                                the SubplotsBase class and the Factory Method(subplot_class_factory)
                                can be found <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_subplots.py">here</a>

                                <p>Note that the _Subplots class diagram does not represent a class. _Subplots is a file that holds the Subplot_class_factory() function. For the sake of simplicity and neatness we made it a class diagram.</p>

                            <p>Not all users of matplotlib know how to use NumPy arrays
                                and lists, but matplotlib depends heavily on NumPy.
                                So to answer this, matplotlib allows users to give
                                regular python lists as input to all their plotting
                                functions. The example in the side image uses the
                                _process_plot_var_args class located <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py">here</a>                                which contains methods that puts the data to be plotted
                                in a format that the Artist can recognize. These
                                methods call the methods of <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/lib/matplotlib/cbook">CBook</a>                                which is a set of files that will be our Adapter.
                                The methods of CBook that are called can take Python
                                lists or NumPy arrays depending on what the user
                                inputed, and in either case a NumPy array is returned.</p>

                            be set on the parallel direction to the respective axis.
                            Eg. a shift vertically on a tick in the y axis does not
                            register but a horizontal one will. The work-around suggested
                            by a user was to manually define a lambda to change the
                            axis coordinate. After a trace of the execution, I still
                            could not pinpoint the exact location of the problem.
                            However, the traces do hint at a possible sequence of
                            calls in the wrong order being the cause of the issue.</p>

                            <p>For basic users, Matplotlib hides away all of the important
                                drawing resources in the Artist and Backend layers
                                by giving them the scripting layer to work off of.
                                For more advanced users, MatplotLib offers certain
                                objects to allow greater control over the figures
                                they create. One of those objects is the SubplotZero
                                object. For most users, when they want to add a subplot
                                they would just call figure.add_subplot() which creates
                                and returns a new Axes and adds it to the figure's
                                AxesStack. SubplotZero() will do the same thing,
                                but the Axes that it returns will be scriptable.
                                A scriptable Axes allows user to access the Axes
                                individual artists. These artists can be used to
                                draw on top of the exisiting Axes.</p>

                            <p>For Example:</p>
                            <pre><code class="python">fig = plt.figure()
ax = SubplotZero(fig, 111)
ax.axis["xzero"].set_visible(True)
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>This would draw another X-axis on top of the Axes the
                                SubplotZero() returned</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4" style="display:inline-block">
                            <p> Issue #7617 states that when creating new a new Y-axis
                                using SubplotZero(), set_ylabel() (which is called
                                by plt.ylabel()) does not change the ylabel on the
                                new axis. As you can see in the "Actual Outcome"
                                on the right the Y-axis' label is x when it should
                                be y. After tracing through the code I discovered
                                that during the creation of the AxisArtist object
                                (which is what ax.axis is in the example above) it
                                uses a variable called axis_direction to determine
                                whether to assign a X-axis or Y-axis to the AxisArtist.

                                The problem was that this axis_direction variable
                                wasn't being passed into the constructor of AxisArtist
                                if you create it using SubplotZero(). So to fix this
                                issue I passed the axis_direction variable into the
                                constructor. You can see the fix <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/commit/4079729f73eda76f5a1bddfc8d3b932aba3a10cc">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>In matplotlib when creating an object to show on screen the artist takes in parameters from pyplot and creates them accordingly. However, because of screen limitations when trying to plot a certain number of ticks (greater than 910) on the screen it will throw a run time error. This is because during the early stages of the project they had to limit the amounts of ticks on screen to save memory and space for the program; however as things evovled the limit eventually became a hinderance as computers have more memory and space. The problem lies in the function raise_if_exceeds that is in the <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/ticker.py#L1432">ticker.py</a> file under the locator class. This function throws an runtime error if it exceeds the MAXTICKS variable to save space, the solution we found was that it seemed like the function was no longer needed so it was safe for us to remove the check within the function. some downsides to this fix is that if exceeded enough if can eventually use up alot of memory, some upsides are that it allows people to plot their graph with more detail. </p>

                            <p>For our first issue we decided to fix issue #8236 which
                                is about adding annotations to legends. An annotation
                                is generally used bring attention to a particular
                                part of a figure by having an arrow point it and
                                a small amount of text to contextualize it. This
                                is not always the case though. Matplotlib's annotations
                                are completely customizable to be any size, placement
                                and style; similar to that of any 2D Line. Therefore,
                                you can use them to represent certain pieces of data
                                such as distance, error margins, or to display increases/decreases
                                over time. When you are doing this you might not
                                want to clutter your figure with text and instead
                                move the text to the legend. As an example, you can
                                see on the image to the left that the user has used
                                an annotation arrow to represent the distance between
                                two lines but does not wish to label the arrow on
                                the figure. As it stands right now there is no way
                                to add an annotation to the legend. </p>
                            <p>In matplotlib when you want to append to your legend
                                you add the "label" key arguement to any plot declaration
                                you make. For example:</p>
                            <pre>
	plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 0], label='line1')
	plt.legend()
	                    	</pre>
                            <p>This will create a line and a note on your legend called
                                "line 1". When you do this for an annotation nothing
                                happens. Our objective is to add this feature to
                                annotations.</p>

                            <p>When planning to add to the legend functionality, one
                                has to understand how legends are built and structured.
                                First of all, Axes contain Legends and Legends contain
                                something called a Legend Handler. Legend Handlers
                                are what actually create the artists that know how
                                to draw the shapes onto the legend. For us to grant
                                the ability to put annotations on legends we would
                                have to write a legend handler for annotations as
                                there currently isn't one. Annotations are considered
                                to be types of text which inherits from Artist; this
                                makes Annotation a type of artist as well. It follows
                                that our legend handler would have to create a new
                                instance of Annotation based on all the aethstetic
                                information the user inputed such as style and colour,
                                but with new structural information such as size
                                and angle to make it fit inside a legend.</p>
                            <p>Note that, Legends aren't initialized until a call to
                                plt.legend() is made. Plotting a line and giving
                                the "label" key arguement will put that Line into
                                the curent Axes' lines field but will not begin to
                                create the legend. When plt.legend() is called the
                                current Axes will begin to initialize its legend_
                                field by making a call to get_legend_handles(). This
                                pulls out all the default handlers from the legend
                                class and creates a new list called handles_original
                                consisting of all the current axes' lines, patches,
                                collections, and containers. It then loops through
                                this new list and grabs all handlers for the the
                                elements where a label key argument has been defined.
                                You can see that code <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L259">here</a>.
                                Using that information it finally instantiates a
                                legend with the handlers as a parameter. During the
                                initialization process the handler's create_artists
                                function is called and the newly created artist is
                                returned and stored in the legend's handler_list
                                field to be used during rendering. You can see a
                                visual representation of this process in the sequence
                                diagram on the left.</p>
                            <p> To implement this feature we need to accomplish two major
                                things. Right now when an annotation is defined it
                                is stored in the Axes' texts field. So, we need to
                                find a way to differentiate between annotations and
                                any other types of text. To do that we need to either
                                create an annotations field or add logic to the creation
                                of the handles_original variable to only take annotations
                                out of the text field at the time of legend instantiation.
                                And of course we would need to write a legend handler
                                for annotations which I described above. </p>

                    		<p>Adding annotations to legends is now possible! You can use it in the same way you add anything else to a legend. When you define an annotation just give it a "label" key arguement and then call plt.legend() or ax.legend().On the left you can see how to define an annotation with an arrow (distance), with text (distance3) and with both (distance2) and what the result now looks like. The aesthetic fields you set on the arrow and text (such as colour and style) will show up on the legend. Note that any size altering, annotation specific property such as "width" or "headlength" will not be copied on to the legend arrow for cleanliness and to match the documentation for the FancyArrowPatch class.</p>

                    		<p>There were very few hiccups when designing the fix for this; all went according to plan. The Diagram below shows am updated UML diagram that displays our new understanding of the issue. Anything in red was either added or updated by us to implement this feature</p>

                    		<p>As we said in the above section, to immplement this feature we needed to build a legend handler class to handle annotations. The question was where we were going to fit it into the legend handler structure. We knew that it had to inherit from HandlerBase as it contains the important function legend_artist() which is how legends interact with legend handlers, as well as the function update_prop() which allows us to copy all relevant aesthetic properties of the the annotations onto the image we create for the legend. But, we also noticed that in terms of a legend an annotation arrow shares certain properties with a line. To know where to place the arrow on the legend we need to get the location in x and y coordinates. The Handler2Dline class already uses functions go calculate the x and y data. Lucky for us the person that originally built this kept this possibility in mind and made a HandlerNpoints class that calculates xdata. So we have our annotation handler inherit from HandlerNpoints so we can get all the important functions of HandlerNpoints and HandlerBase.</p>

                    		<p>Writing the Annotation handler class was straightforward as we just need to implement the create_artists() function which builds and returns instances of the a Text, FancyArrowPatch, or both and return them. You can see the new class <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/legend_handler.py#L182">here</a>.</p>
                    	</div>
                    	<p>Although, our initial solution proved to be more complicated than it needed to be. We initially believed that we needed to differentiate between annotations and other texts as annotations were getting stored inside Axes instances inside a list called texts with all other texts. So to counter that we made an annotations list to separate annotations from other texts. This turned out to be unnecessary. As you can see <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L277">here</a> any element of the texts list that doesn't have a handler is ignored (has_handler() will return false). So non annotation Texts are already siphoned out. Thus, the only other major change needed outside of legend_handler.py is the additoin of our annotation handler to the default list of handlers in Legend.py; this will make has_handler() return true for annotations. You can see that change <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/legend.py#L498">here</a>.</p>

                        <h4>Acceptance Tests</h4>
                        <p>This issue is more of a feature and API addendum. Since this bug involves
                            annotations, our acceptance tests would involve creating
                            everytype of style of annotation and checking if they
                            appear in the legend box. They are based on the documentation
                            in the Annotation class that can be seen <a href="https://github.com/desainis/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/text.py#L2060">here</a>.
                            An annotation Arrow consists of different set styles
                            such as 'wedge', 'fancy', or just '->'. We have to confirm
                            if that arrow created in the legend matches that of the
                            arrow created in the figure and that the label inputed
                            matches the text that appears in the legend box (that
                            is why every label is different). The tests have been updated for D5 to take into account annotation specific properties such as width, headwidth and headlength. These properties will not affect the arrow on the legend as the FancyArrowPatch classw does not use them. you can see the tests
                            here:</p>

                            <p>One of matplotlibs main attractions is the fact that
                                you can customize your graph depending on what you
                                need. For our 2nd Issue we are focusing on Issue
                                number #6830 which is about rotating and customizing
                                labels while using parasite axes. Parasite axes in
                                MPL are regular axes but with the allowance
                                of more customization. One of the main reasons why
                                people use parasite axes is the fact that it can
                                allow people to have multiple Y axes in your graph.
                                The main issue in 6830 is that when you want to rotate the labels of an axis it fails to recognize the command, it ends up always using its default value for the rotation rather than the new updated value. The issue came from the Axis Artist class because when it is told to draw these labels it doesn't properly retrieve the values.

                                <p>To create a parasitic axes you must first import from the package axis_grid1 then you must create a host subplot
                                    that can host the axes so it knows where to show
                                    up on the screen. When creating a parasite axes you
                                    must call the host_subplot function, this function
                                    takes in any number of arguments and creates a host
                                    subplot based on them. It takes in each argument that
                                    it's given and passes it through host_axes_class_factory
                                    and subplot_class_factory to turn into a regular
                                    subplot with those adjustments.</p>
                                <p>In Issue #6830 the problem comes from one of the arguments
                                    when trying to instantiate a host_subplot. When the
                                    argument "rotation" is passed in, it should rotate
                                    the label of the axis by a certain degree, for (rotate=45 should rotate the label text by 45 degrees)
                                    however in its current form this functionality does
                                    not work.</p>

                                    <p>When trying to fix the issue we looked at alot of different classes such as Axis_artist, parasite_axes and text. each of these classes plays an important role in this issue, parasite_axes is the main class that takes in and creates these axes and host_axes it also reads and proccess all of the arguments and adjust them according. Axis_artist is the customized artist that is used to draw the new parasite axes and text is the actual object that of the label, it also holds the rotation value </p>

                            <p>The issue to this problem lies within the axis_artist module, the axisArtist class goes through and takes all the values of the original axe and creates new text objects from them
                            in its draw function which is very different from the regular artist. the main problem was that when it was getting all the values from the original text labels it doesn't accomodate for the rotation variable. the draw function in the axisartist class loops through all the pre-exisiting axes values in the update function sets their values according, it sets all the angles in the _get_tick_info, however in this function it never calls on the original rotation values and uses a default function instead. Therefore even if the rotation variable is correctly set and the original object is working properly it still would not draw the rotation because of the way axisArtist draws them. This is most likey just a simple oversight because the rest of the angle calculation is correct. </p>
                            <p> the fix</p> 
                            <p>the function get_tick_info is in the AxisArtist class so it has access to the original axe values, and because of this we can loop through all the original values and retrieve its rotation value. we then assign it on to the angle_label variable too the appropriate label. now axis_artist has a proper call to the rotation value of the original axes class, so will constantly update the value even if it is changed later on.</p>

                            <pre>
for x in self.axes.get_xticklabels():
    if label == x.get_text()
        angle_label += ticklabel_add_angle
                            </pre>



                            <p>The fix for this bug was only 3 lines of code, however the majority of the time was spent tracing and realizing where the variable was dropped. axis_artist is very different from the actual artist class. for example creating a resetting the text object when a draw is called is completely different from how artist creates it, this is because the axis_artist needs to be able to reposistion these objects. At first we thought the problem was in the actually declaration of the rotation variable, that it couldn't set the variable properly, but we soon found out that the variable was correct but because of how the axis_artist draws the labels by creating a new text object, that was where the problem is.</p>
