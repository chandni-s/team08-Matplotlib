                                <p>I am a computer science student currently in my last
                                    year of studies; I've always had a passion for
                                    computer science ever since high and have dabbled
                                    into multiple side projects. Throughout all my
                                    experiences I've had the pleasure of being about
                                    to come across a wide array of different languages
                                    such as Java, python and C# which helped the
                                    diversity of all my projects. A lot of the side
                                    projects I've worked on revolve around the game
                                    engine unity; I go to game jams (hackathons for
                                    game development) every year and work on new
                                    and creative projects each year with other game
                                    developers. Last year I was also able to do a
                                    PEY term which lasted a year, in my job placement
                                    I was able to work with a wide variety of technologies
                                    and experience what it is like to work in a large
                                    agile team with daily scrum meetings.</p>

                                <p>As a recovering coffee addict, I am currently pursuing
                                    a bachelors in computer science in the comprehensive
                                    stream at University of Toronto. My favourite
                                    courses at the University of Toronto have been
                                    Computer and Network Security and Algorithms.
                                    As if that were not enough, I have had two successful
                                    (but long) work terms as part of the Co-op program
                                    at University of Toronto. The first work term
                                    consisted of quality assurance work, specifically
                                    writing unit tests as well as front end user
                                    testing which lasted for eight months. The next
                                    work term was a hefty sixteen months long for
                                    which I developed many types of Microsoft applications
                                    within a core ERP software package. The quality
                                    assurance and development experience provides
                                    me with the skills and knowledge I need in order
                                    to become an effective team member. I plan to
                                    apply my skills that I have developed in these
                                    two years in order to build a great project.</p>

                                    QA, and Software Development positions. Throughout
                                    my undergraduate studies, I have worked with
                                    programming languages such as Java, C, Python,
                                    and SQL. Through my work terms, my interest in
                                    development have led to work with other languages
                                    such as VBA, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am familiar
                                    with software development tools such as Eclipse,
                                    GitHub, and SVN, as well as project management
                                    tools such as Trello. I can work well in both
                                    an independent and a team environment. I believe
                                    I can be great contributor in any project and
                                    I am confident in my logical thinking, creativity,
                                    communication, and organization skills. Away
                                    from the desk, I enjoy building relationships
                                    through physical activities including basketball,
                                    snowboarding, mixed martial arts, and volleyball.</p>

                                <p>I am a computer science specialist currently in my
                                    fourth year, aiming to graduate in spring 2017.
                                    I was initially exposed to programming in high
                                    school during grade 11. I realized my passion
                                    for technology when I explored other courses
                                    and programs for a year, and did not find anything
                                    else as interesting and compelling as computer
                                    science. I took an opportunity of having a prolonged
                                    internship experience for sixteen months at IBM,
                                    where I was able to learn many new programming
                                    languages such as ReactJs, NodeJs, C++ and Perl
                                    as well as optimized my skills in Java and Python.
                                    Furthermore, I had an opportunity to explore
                                    my enthusiasm for teaching by becoming a TA for
                                    a database course in the fall term. I am continuing
                                    with my passion in current semester by TA’ing
                                    the same subject at downtown. Through this course,
                                    I aim to utilize my teamwork and technical skills
                                    to contribute to an open source project and hope
                                    to have a good learning experience overall.</p>

										<p>Team work is a great opportunity one could have however, if not managed properly it can become a disastrous experience. In Forkestra, all the team members have tremendous group work experiences both in the industry and in school. Through these experiences, we all agree on the fact that the key for success in a team environment project is communication.</p>

										<p>In order to keep the team focused on our project and have a successful term overall, we have agreed to use various modern development and project management tools. This includes: GitHub to manage our project code, a Slack channel for project related communication, a Facebook group chat for emergency issues and Trello which would act as our scrum board to keep up with the progress of our work. Considering the fact that the team members are taking other courses as well, we have agreed to have two mandatory meetings each week; one on Thursdays where each team member will decide what they will work on over the weekend. We agree to have another team meeting on Mondays after meeting with TA where we will examine the feedback given by our TA and go over the work done over the weekend. The frequency of these meetings will escalate as we approach closer to a deliverable due date for the project. </p>

                    <h3>Matplotlib</h3>
                    <div class="col-lg-12" style="display:inline-block">
                        <p>Matplotlib is a program created by John D Hunter to plot
                            graphs and other functions similar to MATLAB. The program
                            is an open source on github and has been going strong
                            even though John died in 2012. </p>

                            <p>Matplotlib is broken up
                            into three main layers which builds on top of each other.
                            These layers are, from top to bottom respectively: the
                            Scripting Layer, the Artist Layer, and the Backend Layer.
                            Each one of these layers is abstracted from each other
                            and <b>does not rely on the any of the layers above it</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>The scripting layer</b>: is the interface between the
                            user and the matplotlib library, mainly using the pyplot
                            module. Pyplot provides interaction with the classes
                            in the layers below it. This allows the user to easily
                            generate and manipulate graphs through simple method
                            calls, such as plotting a graph like below: </br><pre>import matplotlib, pyplot as plt
                            </br>plt.plot();</pre></p>

                            <p>PyPlot is an implementation
                            of a stateful program which helps with its memory usage.
                            It does so by using different states to keep track of
                            things like current figure, canvas area and current axes.</p>

                            <p><b>Transition Scripting Layer -> Artist Layer</b>:
                            PyPlot imports all classes of the artist layer
                            such as Axes, subplots, Lines, Artist, Figure and others
                            which it uses in its functions to tell the machine what
                            to draw. It does so through appropriate sequences of
                            method calls to the respective classes. This translate
                            to a high degree of coupling from the Scripting
                            Layer to the Artist Layer.</p>

                            <p><b>The Artist Layer</b>:
                            The main goal of the artist layer is to draw the
                            graph based on parameters passed in the scripting layer.
                            It consists of 2 different types of artists, primitives
                            and containers. Primitive objects represents the basic
                            images needed to make graphs such as Line 2D, Rectangle,
                            Text and other images. Container objects represents where
                            you draw the primitives on, such as Axis, Axes, and Figure.</p>

                            <p>In the Artist layer, the Figure class is the base class
                            needed to instantiate everything else; it is the window
                            on which Axes and subplots are drawn. The Axes class
                            contains most of the elements such as Text, Line, Axis
                            and Ticks. Each Axes object has a subplot object assigned
                            to it, which is used to manipulate properties of these
                            elements. The subplot class is what actually controls
                            the graph on the screen and as people change parameters
                            and elements of a graph, they call functions within subplot
                            and Axes class.<p>
                            <p><b>Transition Artist Layer -> Backend Layer</b>:
                            When the artist wants to render the graph
                            on the screen, it calls on the Backends_bases module
                            which is the gateway to the backends package that renders
                            the pictures. The coupling between these two layers are
                            low.</p>

                            <p><b>The Backend layer</b>: is the
                            layer which handles rendering the actual graph on screen.
                            The backend package handles displaying all the physical
                            properties of lines, such as colors and plots to show
                            up on the screen. The classes backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase,
                            backend_bases.RendererBase and backend_bases.GraphicsContextBase
                            implement the backend layer to handle creating the canvas,
                            rendering the images, and rendering the colors respectively.</p>

                     <p ><b>Potential Improvements</b> </p>
                            <p>1) We've noticed that there were numerous imports from the Scripting Layer (pyplot) to the Artist Layer (Axes, Labels, etc). This could cause problems if any of the classes depended on gets deprecated or refactored. Also, if there was a desire to implement a new interface in place of pyplot, it could be an ordeal to ensure every needed dependencies are imported. An interface in the Artist Layer could reduce the level of coupling between it and the Scripting Layer.</p>
                            <p>2) In the factory design pattern involving _Subplots.py to generate AxesSubplots objects, Subplot_class_factory generates different types depending on input; however, the generated classes is always inherting from SubplotBase. If new parent objects were introduced, the current design would require additional condition statements, which does not follow the Open/closed principle of Object-Oriented methodology.</p>

                            <p style="padding-right:15px">When it comes time to draw the the actual figure a Decorator
                                pattern is used. The Decorator is important to allow
                                customization to your chart. With a Decorator you
                                can have a chart with any permutation of lines, images,
                                text, legends, etc. Each part of the figure has access
                                to the Artist class located <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/artist.py">here</a>                                (lines were only drawn connecting figure becasue
                                when creating a new window the Artist begins with
                                the Figure class, but all the classes on the right
                                extend Artist, when it needs to be drawn it hands
                                its draw() method to Artist which in turn gives it
                                to the renderer to actually draw. Think of the Renderer
                                as the paintbrush and the Artist as the one who knows
                                how to paint. This Decorator spans two layers: the
                                Artist and the Backend. The order that objects are
                                drawn is determined by a value in each of the classes
                                called zorder, and the actual drawing takes place
                                in a function call allow_rasterization located in
                                artist.py. </p>

                            <p>There is actually a lot of setup that must go into the
                                backend before the actual drawing can occur. To help
                                your understanding you can look at the sequence diagram
                                (the second diagram) to the right that shows and
                                explains the execution of a plt.show() command.</p>

                            <h4><u>Factory</u></h4>
                            <p>This Factory is used when adding subplots to a figure.
                                A figure can contain multiple Axes which contain
                                subplot information defined in the subplotBase class.
                                When the user adds a new subplot, the current figure's
                                <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/figure.py">add_subplot</a>                                method will run which in turn asks for a new instance
                                of a subplot. The SubplotBase class is meant to be
                                used as an interface. We don't want the current Figure's
                                Axes to contain an instance of SubplotBase. So instead matplotlib
                                dynamically creates an instance of the class AxesSubplot
                                which will have all the methods of SubplotBase. Both
                                the SubplotsBase class and the Factory Method(subplot_class_factory)
                                can be found <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_subplots.py">here</a>

                                <p>Note that the _Subplots class diagram does not represent a class. _Subplots is a file that holds the Subplot_class_factory() function. For the sake of simplicity and neatness we made it a class diagram.</p>

                            <p>Not all users of matplotlib know how to use NumPy arrays
                                and lists, but matplotlib depends heavily on NumPy.
                                So to answer this, matplotlib allows users to give
                                regular python lists as input to all their plotting
                                functions. The example in the side image uses the
                                _process_plot_var_args class located <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py">here</a>                                which contains methods that puts the data to be plotted
                                in a format that the Artist can recognize. These
                                methods call the methods of <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/lib/matplotlib/cbook">CBook</a>                                which is a set of files that will be our Adapter.
                                The methods of CBook that are called can take Python
                                lists or NumPy arrays depending on what the user
                                inputed, and in either case a NumPy array is returned.</p>
